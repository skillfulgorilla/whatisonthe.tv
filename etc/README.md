# Explanation

This is primarily a holding directory for 'stuff'. Mostly infrastructure stuff
that exists outside the realm of the 'django app' - 'server configs, 
deployments' that sort of stuff.

## codeship

[Codeship](http://www.codeship.com) is used to deploy the app. In this directory
there are several bash scripts that are named after the sections noted in the 
CS steps. I should probably envoke make commands for these instead of hard-coding 
them. However it works for the time being.
